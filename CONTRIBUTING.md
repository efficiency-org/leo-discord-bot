## Making an issue

You should pick an issue template if it will work for your issue, but feel free to create a blank one if they don't. Doing just this will highly increase the chance of your issue getting proiritized and added to a project and/or milestone that it best fits and given more attention and enough information.

1. Add some milestones.
