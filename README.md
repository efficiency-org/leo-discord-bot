# leo-discord-bot

Our most feature-rich and exciting Discord bot is coming in fast - this bot!
***Make sure to follow the Contributing guidelines.***

## Invite

You can quickly add the bot with this invite link: 

<https://discord.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=750140073009348638&scope=bot&permissions=2146958847>.

## Required Things

Make sure to allow all of the permissions on the invite screen, or else the bot might not be able to run some commands :(

You only need to allow the permissions to send messages, read text channels & see voice channels, and send embeds for the ***most basic commands***, but that's all that's available for those permissions.
